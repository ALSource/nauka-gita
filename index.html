            <p>Sometimes I get to feeling I was back in the old days - long ago <br>When we were kids, when we were young<br>Things seemed so perfect - you know?<br> The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young<br>The sun was always shinin - we just lived for fun <br>Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know <br>The rest of my life's been - just a show</p>
            
            <p>Those were the days of our lives<br>The bad things in life were so few<br>Those days are all gone now but one thing is true <br>When I look and I find I still love you</p>


            <p>You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide - ain't that a shame? <br>I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride <br>When life was just a game <br>No use and sitting and thinking on what you did <br>When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids<br>Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know<br> Better sit back and go - with the flow</p>
            
            <p>Cause these are the days of our lives <br>They've flown in the swiftness of time <br>These days are all gone now but some things remain <br>When I look and I find - no change</p> 
            
            <p>Those were the days of our lives yeah <br>The bad things in life were so few <br>Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true <br>When I look and I find- <br>I still love you, I still love you</p>
